Automagically manages your torrents seed life ! (wip)

* Manage/maintain a global ratio
* Allow a limited period of unlimited seed (before switching back to the global ratio control)
* Does not mess with custom ratio torrents (skip them)
* (optionnal) Auto delete finished torrent (when seed has reached the ratio limit)
