Automagically manages your torrents seed life ! (wip)

* Manages/maintains a minimal global ratio
* Does not mess with custom ratio torrents (skip them)
* (optionnal) Allows a limited period of unlimited seed (before switching back to the global ratio control)
* (optionnal) Auto deletes finished torrents (for stopped torrent whith ratio above the configured target)
